  <p>
    Welcome to my dingy little corner of the internet. You've stumbled upon an
    odd place...you see, I'm not really a developer. I'm not qualified to do
    anything that I do here. I, my friend, am just a professional piddler. I see
    code, I change code, I break and I fix code. It's my addiction and I love
    it, and I will never stop.
